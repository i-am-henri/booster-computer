# Introduction

Booster is a tool to quickly create a new project with a graphical user interface. It is based on [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Booster allows you to create templates by simply selecting the desired features. After that, you can download the template with our cli and start working on your platform. We are supporting monorepos, multi-package apps, Nextjs apps and more.

We are currently working on a web version of Booster.
