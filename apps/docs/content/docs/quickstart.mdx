# Quickstart

You can sign up for a new booster account and you can start creating your own templates. To do so, you need to have an account on [Booster](https://booster.computer). Afrer you have verified your email, you can create your own template with our editor and create new packages. To download them later, you can install the booster cli. To install an package, run the booster install command and provide the cli with your template id. Every id is unique. When you want to clone a private template, you first need to signup with the sign up command to access the package.
